Two adolescent girls on a hot summer night-- hardly the material of great 
literature, which tends to endow all male experience (that of those twin 
brothers who found themselves adrift so many years ago in the dark northern 
woods for instance) with universal radiance. Faithless sons, wars and 
typhoons, fields of blood, greed and knives: our literature's full of such 
stories. And yet suppose for an instant that it wasn't the complacent father 
but his bored daughter who was the Prime Mover; suppose that what came first 
wasn't an appetite for drama but the urge to awaken it. Mightn't we then 
permit a single summer in the lives of two bored girls to represent an 
essential stage in the history of the universe?
