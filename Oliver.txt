There are some people who belong to the land of the dead and some who belong 
to the land of the living. And there are some who stand between the two, 
keeping open the door. These are the artists, dreamers, philosophers and 
mystics. They are strange people who tell of strange things. We must be 
patient with them. I myself, in my humble way, stand between these two 
worlds. I make the pastries. I wait. We all have our roles, as I believe 
you do.
